# MyOffice

This project has been launch to up my skill on the Unreal Editor based on the Ben Tristem's Course : Escape Building. 
Few things have been added to the initial project :

# design
Customized from my reality based office. Desk and some textures have been made with Unreal. More complex objets are DLed .obj or .obx files from the web.

# default pawn
Current default pawn can open doors with a trigger volume. It can switch lights to on/off. A video asset is running within the scene.
